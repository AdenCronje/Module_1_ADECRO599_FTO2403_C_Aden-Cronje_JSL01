What I learned: In JSL01 i learned about logic and how you state it in your code, I also learned about range and
                how you can specify between how low and how high you want your values to go. I also learned a little bit more about arrays.

Struggles: I struggled a lot with how to get the full string to display valid when "pet_" + birthYear + petName are put in the input field.
           After eventually getting that to work the next challenge was getting the birthYear to work between a specific range.

Improvements: The only real way I can improve is just trying more practice materials and learning more new ways to write my code.
